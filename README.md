Logistic Regression is a supervised learning model. It uses classification algorithm where our target variable is in classes or categories. Sampling is possible and we have performed it on Credit Risk Dataset. 

Following steps are involved:

1. Import the necessary libraries in our Jupyter notebook.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Perform Data Cleaning -- fill missing values, standardization, normalization, etc.
4. Random Sampling by splitting data into train and test data.
5. Build the model with logistic regression on train (fit on train).
6. Predict on test data.
7. Build the confusion matrix to be able to evaluate/judge the performance of our model.
8. Evaluate the model using various parameters like accuracy, recall, precision and f1 ratio along with the AUROC Curve.
